# Python script for converting input text into Morse code
# Idea being to display Morse version of text using blinking LED
# Down the line this could become a lab in which messages are transmitted
# using Morse and received and decoded using a Pre-Amp Receiver
# Will need to define a dictionary using the ITU Morse alphabet and
# write a function for converting the text into Morse
# Message will be transmitted using GPIO controlled blinking LED
# Aim is to demonsrtate that something useful can be done with the RPi
# Use as much of Python's built-in string handling capabilities as possible
